I couldn't implement background processes due to lack of time :(

Testcases Tested:
1. ls -lah /dev | cat | wc
2. ls -lR /
3. ls -lR / | wc
4. < /home/z/sish/scp.sh cat | more
5. cat <in >out
6. cd /
7. echo $$
8. echo $?
9. exit
10. something -al
11. uname | cat | grep Net
12. ls -al >something | cat <something | more
13. ls -al >something >>something2
14. ls -l /dev | grep wd6 | wc -l

Things that were really hard
1. Properly parsing strings is really hard
2. Understanding piping across commands and properly duping

Weird Bugs
1. Once in a while whatever the args you pass get appended with the program name
    ex: ls something -> changes to ls somethingls
    Some weird pointer issue, I tried to replicate this again but I could only find it in rare cases
    but one test case with a specific file name failed multiple times
    i.e ls /tmp/out -- For some reason for this path ony /tmp/out it is consistently getting appended
    I tried to debug but couldn't find the root cause.
    I have tried alot of other paths like / /dev/ /home/z/sish/scp.sh etc
